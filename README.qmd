Analysis of the [IMD data]("https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/68ff547a49d08dd781b48351/ID_2025_Research_Report.pdf") released a few weeks ago.

Use the city centre location (obtained using tmaptools::geocode_osm(city_name)) to create a clockboard for each city using zonebuilder package.

Intersect with the polygons from the IMD data IMD_polys[clockboard,]

![](plots/city_polys.png)
Grid this data using terra::rasterize()

![](plots/city_grids.png)
Use exactextractr package to calculate the mean of each clockboard cell exact_extract(gridded_city,clockboard, fun = "mean")

No background map as this map is supposed to be minimal (day 11 30daymapchallenge)
